# Documenting My Team Treehouse SQL Exercises

### About
I'm going through the SQL learning track on Team Treehouse. Part of the reason for this is that I am trying to improve my understanding of SQL as well as ensure I am on the same page with the students of Code the Dream, of whom I am mentoring.

The answers are for my own personal reference in case I need to grab something during a mentor session or if I want to personally reference something for my own edification.
