- What is normalization?
    `The process of designing a relational database.`

- What is a "set"
    `A collection of things that have common properties`

- What is the name of the type of diagram that represents a set?
    `A Venn Diagram`

- A Primary Key will allow one NULL value, but no more than that.
    `False. (Primary keys are non-null keys)`

- What data type does a primary key have to be?
    `Either, (Integer or Text) as long as the value guarantees uniqueness`

- What happens when a Unique Constraint is violated in a database system?
    `The database does not allow the data to be written to the table and an error is returned`

- Which of the following is NOT something a database key can do?
    `Guarantee a table does not return data when queried unless a specific password is supplied`

- What are Foreign Keys?
    `They are columns that contain data which relate to the Primary Key in another table`

- Once a Foreign Key Constraint is created to enforce the referential integrity between two tables, what happens if you try to insert a value that does NOT exist in the primary key table?
    `It will NOT insert the data, and will return an error`

- The thing that defines the physical relationship between two tables in a database is called:
    `Foreign Key Constraint`

- If NO Foreign Key Constraint exists between two tables, it is possible to accidentally record data in a foreign key column that does not have a matching value in the primary key table.
    `True`

- Which relationship type is the most common in a relational database?
    `One to Many`

- What do we do to handle a Many to Many relationship between tables during the design process?
    `Add a third table between the original tables`

- Where does the INNER JOIN clause go in a SQL statement?
    `After FROM clause but before WHERE clause`

- What is the most common type of JOIN?
    `INNER JOIN`

- What is a JOIN?
    `It is how a SQL query combines data from two tables into one result set`

- A left outer join returns all data from the first -- or left -- table and only the data with matches in the second table.
    `True`

- Which is the valid SQL statement with JOIN
    ```
    SELECT *
    FROM TableA
    INNER JOIN TableB ON TableA.ColumnID = TableB.ColumnID
    ```
- In a car database there is a Model table with columns, ModelID, MakeID and ModelName and a Car table with columns, CarID, ModelID, VIN, ModelYear and StickerPrice.

    For all cars in the database, show Model Name, VIN and Sticker Price in one result set.

        ```
        SELECT ModelName, VIN, StickerPrice
        FROM Model
        INNER JOIN Car ON Model.ModelID = Car.ModelID;
        ```

- In a car database there is a Make table with columns, MakeID and MakeName, a Model table with columns, ModelID, MakeID and ModelName and a Car table with columns, CarID, ModelID, VIN, ModelYear and StickerPrice.

    For all cars in the database, show Make Name, Model Name, VIN and Sticker Price from the Model and Car tables in one result set.

        ```
        SELECT MakeName, ModelName, VIN, StickerPrice
        FROM Make
        INNER JOIN Model ON Make.MakeID = Model.MakeID
        INNER JOIN Car on Model.ModelID = Car.ModelID;
        ```
- In a car database there is a Sale table with columns, SaleID, CarID, CustomerID, LocationID, SalesRepID, SaleAmount and SaleDate. The database also has a SalesRep table with columns, SalesRepID, FirstName, LastName, SSN, PhoneNumber, StreetAddress, City, State and ZipCode.

    Show the First and Last Name of each sales rep along with SaleAmount from both the SalesRep and Sale tables in one result set.

        ```
        SELECT FirstName, LastName, SaleAmount
        FROM Sale
        INNER JOIN SalesRep ON Sale.SalesRepID = SalesRep.SalesRepID;
        ```

- In a car database there is a Model table with columns, ModelID, MakeID and ModelName and a Car table with columns, CarID, ModelID, VIN, ModelYear and StickerPrice.

    Show all Model names from the Model table along with VIN from the Car table. Make sure models that arenâ€™t in the Car table still show in the results!

        ```
        SELECT ModelName, VIN
        FROM Model
        LEFT OUTER JOIN Car ON Model.ModelID = Car.ModelID;
        ```

- In a car database there is a Sale table with columns, SaleID, CarID, CustomerID, LocationID, SalesRepID, SaleAmount and SaleDate. The database also has a SalesRep table with columns, SalesRepID, FirstName, LastName, SSN, PhoneNumber, StreetAddress, City, State and ZipCode.

    Show all SaleDate, SaleAmount, and SalesRep First and Last name from Sale and SalesRep. Make sure that all Sales appear in results even if there is no SalesRep associated to the sale.

        ```
        SELECT SaleDate, SaleAmount, FirstName, LastName
        FROM Sale
        LEFT OUTER JOIN SalesRep ON Sale.SalesRepID = SalesRep.SalesRepID;
        ```
